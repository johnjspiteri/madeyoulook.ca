	"bio": "Pamela creates sculptural forms that exude an elegant, confident style. Her contemporary and modern designs are inspired by her love of architecture. 'To me, exploring a great building is like immersing myself into a great sculpture. I strive to express this admiration by creating sculptural forms, distinguished by stylized curves, dramatic angles, and captivating twists.' Trained professionally as an engineer, Pamela led a rewarding career in the software industry for ten years. She then fulfilled her dream of becoming a goldsmith by completing the Graduate Jeweler program at the Revere Academy of Jewelry Arts in San Francisco. Pamela also completed the Graduate Gemologist program at the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) in California, which helped her develop a keen eye to personally select each gemstone that finds its way into her creations.",
