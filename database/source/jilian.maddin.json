	"bio": "Jilian Maddin has been making her mark as a custom goldsmith for the better part of a decade. With an eye for unique textures, shapes and colours, Jilianâ€™s jewellery brings together a unique fusion that is distinct and refreshing. Featuring an aesthetic that explores old world influences with rich jewel tones and complex layers, blended with an approach that is highly inventive, experimental and modern. The result is a body of work that is connected to the past with an exciting nod to the future. Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba to artistic parents, Jilian had an early exposure to the world of art, film, music and design. Calling Toronto home since the age of seven, Jilian studied environmental design at the Ontario College of Art and Design and went on to study Jewellery Design at George Brown College as well as the Jewellery Arts Institute in New York City.",
