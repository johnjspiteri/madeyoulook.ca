	"bio": "Colleen Poitras envelopes an original style sensibility with her use of materials, marrying leather with metals, crystals and semi precious stones. Colleen Poitras offers an original design style with her use and explorations of materials, marrying hand dyed leather with metals, crystals with concrete and resins with semi precious stones. Growing up with a seamstress mother and working with various designers early on, allowed for an appreciation of fashion in its many forms. Following her passion, she studied jewellery arts at George Brown College and The Mississauga Centre for the Arts, which furthered her love of design. This has given confidence and a voice to what is now known as a very distinctive and original jewellery and accessories line. Fashion and art go hand in hand. Colleenâ€™s vast interest in both allows her to explore both sides of the coin, accessing her own expression through creating a product that allows others to tap into their own.",
