	"bio": "Handcrafted out of polymer clay by Karen Pasieka, the Liâ€™l Bouquet jewellery collection from Subtle Details is deigned to be feminine, romantic, and whimsical, all with a vintage feel in mind.  Karen is a self-taught polymer clay artist.  Her long-standing experience with the medium is complimented by her design background in architecture. Always happy to work one-on-one with her customers on pieces tailored to their needs, Karen takes pride in her designs being versatile.  With sterling silver, Swarovski crystals, and pearls, these designs vary from being the perfect splash of fun for everyday, to understated elegance for bridal!",
