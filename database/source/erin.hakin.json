	"bio": "As an artist, I have always been drawn to shapes, patterns and colour. Initially, making jewellery was a way to stimulate my mind by constructing arrangements of beads and stones. Over time, my creativity and training evolved to making pieces using precious metals and gemstones. My inspiration is both visual and intuitive and is derived from a variety of sources. The work I am currently making is drawn from my personal relationship and interest in the coastal forests of British Columbia. I look at the beauty in renewal and strive to create asymmetrical pieces that capture the same balance created by nature. The esthetic I use to fabricate each piece has a strong influence from my studies of mid-century modern jewellery. Designing and creating jewellery is my way of leaving a mark in the world of art, design and style.",
