	"bio": "Mizdragonfly is a line of limited-edition jewellery at the intersection of old Hollywood glam and quirky street style. Handmade in Toronto by designer Karine Eyamie, Mizdragonfly’s standout accessories don’t just complement an outfit— they make it. 'My goal as a designer is to create unique pieces for women to express their conﬁdence and individuality,' says Karine, who seamlessly mixes new and recycled materials to create surefire conversation starters. Karine was drawn to the arts at a young age and began to express herself through abstract drawings and interior design. She studied communication and sociology at the University of Ottawa before working in advertising and for the federal government. In 2006, Karine combined her wide-ranging skills with her bold fashion sense to launch Mizdragonfly. In a sea of fast fashion conformity, Karine’s designs allow wearers to create truly unique looks without breaking the bank. 'I’ve always been fascinated by the way people put themselves together. I’m especially mesmerized when I see someone wearing Mizdragonﬂy as a form of self expression'. Fun, fierce, fabulous: Each Mizdragonfly creation is as special as you are!",
