Believing in leaving behind a smaller eco footprint and less disposable fashion, Green Bijou was created to bring about inspired couture jewelry combining true vintage materials with fresh ideas. Each piece is a fusion of modern style and aged adornment, with a lifetime of love and a new story to tell.",
