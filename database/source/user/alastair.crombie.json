His creative background combined with his abilities in clever interpretation and critical evaluation allows him to create unique pieces of the highest quality. Though jewellery is often viewed on a surface level, Alastair enjoys investigating the more complex and peculiar depths of conceptual form. Inspired by organic structures, science, toys and kinetic art, he creates sculptural one off pieces alongside playful and wearable production jewellery.",
