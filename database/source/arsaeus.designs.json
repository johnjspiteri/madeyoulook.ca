	"bio": "Arsaeus Designs is a Toronto-based jewellery brand. The designer and metalsmith is an OCAD University graduate. Following her travels throughout Mediterranean Europe and North Africa, her fascination for Moorish and Classical design began to heavily influence her artistic work. The Arsaeus collection features fine interpretations of ancient architecture and decorative artifacts, handmade into brass, bronze and sterling silver. Pure geometries and organic motifs are derived, recombined and forged into rings and necklaces with historic and mythological allure.",
