	"bio": "Jules Roman spent years working in design & production and throughout that time began compiling a scrapbook filled with his own unique designs and concepts, to one day develop a line of jewellery. Using his diverse experience and his understanding of unusual materials, Jules developed a highly unique product. His is a sculpture, he is an innovator and he is on the cutting edge of the fashion and wearable art scene here in Toronto. A true collector must own one of Jules Romanâ€™s pieces. His work is big, and it is bold but it is superbly fine, beautifully proportioned and exquisite from every angle. He has stretched every boundary that exists in conventional jewellery making and has created work that always garners strong reaction.",
