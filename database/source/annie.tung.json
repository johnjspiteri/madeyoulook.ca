	"bio": "Toronto based artist/designer Annie Tung spent a year in Vancouver studying Art at the University of British Columbia. She returned to Toronto where she graduated from Ontario College of Art & Design. She completed a three-year artist-residency at Harbourfront Centre exploring her multi-disciplinary practice, which includes art and design in jewellery, sculpture and objects. Annie has historically worked on an intimate scale with metals and mixed media. She enjoys working on collaborations with creatives in other industries to realize projects that address design, craftsmanship and notions of luxury. Whether itâ€™s finding new expressions in traditional crafts, exploring the limits of the latest technology or re-visiting familiar objects and materials, she is open to a wide range of perspectives. Annie works on commissions and self-initiated projects. Her work has been recognized by awards, grants and scholarships.",
