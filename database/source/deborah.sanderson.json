	"bio": "Deborah Sanderson is a Toronto based designer goldsmith who has mastered the technique of reticulation. She is drawn to natural textured surfaces in her jewelry that show an unexpected movement in the metal and a depth that reflects a true handmade process. Jagged edges, wrinkles, cracks and crevices help to create a look that is organic and alive. Deborah utilizes antique mother of pearl buttons, that have been sourced from around the world, found objects and recycled silver. It is part of Deborahâ€™s creative process to use natural materials and reuse old materials that want to be made beautiful again. Reticulated silver occurs when the metal is heated to a near melting temperature and the fine silver top layer skin cools faster than the interior and as a result it buckles creating a veined texture resembling a web-like grid.",
