	"bio": "While constantly changing and evolving as an artist, Anat is always drawn to colour and texture. Our natural surroundings become the source of her inspiration; each ANOUK piece is sculpted by hand to evoke the earth’s most powerful elemental textures, such as the movement of waves, grains of sand, or porous rock. 'The ancient jewellery of Greece, Rome and Byzantium reflects the primal approach to artistry, bringing out the natural beauty of the precious materials, and leaving a distinct hand print of their maker. I am inspired by the rich tones of metals, the bold colours of precious stones – the nobility of nature’s resources.'",
