	"bio": "I am drawn by my instinct that brings me to the special places outdoors that allow me to slip into a reflective and receptive mode. As a seeker of understanding, I am developing a relationship with nature through everyday gratitude. To connect with the earth with my feet in the grass, through my wonder at the stars and the moon, and the quiet moments I share with the trees, I feed the creative spirit within. By collecting objects from nature such as; leaves, twigs, seeds, roots, and bones, then studying these shapes, I create wearable pieces that speak to my wonder and gratefulness of the natural world. I use the imprints of leaves to texture metal, I use the shape of bones to create structure for a piece and I use branches and roots to bring a new perspective to the admirer and wearer. My process is one of discovery, pieces from nature are cast directly and then incorporated into a design. Sometimes the object from nature brings inspiration for texture or shape of a piece. I use silver for its workability and copper for its transformative abilities. I use bronze for its strength and colour, and gold for its beauty. I use stones for their magical properties, beauty and colour. Hair and wool are used for their soft and unusual textures.",
