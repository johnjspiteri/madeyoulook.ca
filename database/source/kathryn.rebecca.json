It is an opportunity to get to know someoneâ€™s vision and style in order to create a piece that they will enjoy wearing daily as a reminder of the one they love. I have had the privilege of working on pieces that are traditional as well as non-traditional for this special occasion. Whether you would like a classic diamond or stunning coloured gemstone I would love to work with you to create the perfect piece to reflect your personal taste.",
