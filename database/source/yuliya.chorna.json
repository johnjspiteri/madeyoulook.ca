	"bio": "Yuliya’s work has evolved through years of experimentation and process driven practice. Her signature collection features large scale couture pieces that were designed to turn heads and challenge our ideas about what formal wear can look like. Yuliya’s exploitation of materials and their working properties is where her work begins. Rough ideas and forms transform into a body of work that is provocative, innovative and highly creative. Yuliya explores unusual processes employing patinas and industrial lacquers to bring color into her work. Her jewellery can be simple and highlight the raw elegance of a beautiful and rare gemstone, or it can be deeply symbolic exploring reflective and emotional themes.",
