Now with Slashpile Designs, they combine the product-oriented discipline of industrial design with the artistic quality of fine craft. Tara and Courtney are driven to create work of personal significance to the wearer. Drawing from an eclectic mix of experiences and interests, fused with a sense of humour and perceptive insight into human behaviour, they create pieces that are both meaningful to the wearer and pleasing to the eye.",
