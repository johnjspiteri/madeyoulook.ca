	"bio": "I am treasure hunting every day, selecting random, attractive odds and ends, and outstanding little bits to re-design into one-of-a-kind jewellery. I have been a collector my whole life, starting with sticker books and fancy rocks, even dance trophies for a time. Eventually I moved on to comic books, action figures and vintage clothing. At the moment, I enjoy collecting antiquated fashion, photography books, Victorian jewellery, old trinkets, as well as many types of vestiges. I also have an unquenchable thirst for footwear! Making jewellery brings all of my interests together, allowing me to explore how found object can work together, incorporating miniatures and using pop-culture imagery to tell a story.",
