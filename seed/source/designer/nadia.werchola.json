	"bio": "Nadia Werchola’s jewellery collection begins with each unique gemstone. After carefully selecting only the most rare and unusual rough cuts and colours she transforms each gem by encasing them into her own raw, edgy, angular handmade settings. She enjoys using graulation and dark patinas to deepen the texture and intensify the look of each piece. The style is modern, urban, bold, and strong that is also able to offer a feminine quality that touches the ancient goddess within. There is a regal quality to Nadia’s work that fills the collection with an air of status and power, it is impossible to not take on some of that energy while wearing this work.",
