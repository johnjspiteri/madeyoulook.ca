	"bio": "Liel and Lentz was founded by childhood friends Diandra Guglielmello and Maggie Coblentz. Back in their hometown the two friends decided to combine their passions through the launch of Liel and Lentz, with Diandra running business operations and Maggie as designer. The company is currently located in Toronto, ON. Maggie received a Bachelor of Design from Ryerson University in Toronto, but has also studied fashion at Parsons in NYC, and the National Institute of Fashion Technology in New Delhi, India. Travel is one of Maggie’s biggest sources of inspiration. It was in India that her exposure to diverse materials, colours, and modes of production led her to a career in jewelry design. Maggie’s grandmother used to design jewelry and she inherited her original set of tools that she uses to this day. Diandra’s involvement in the business of fashion grew out of her extensive background in retail. Her understanding of the fashion industry is a product of her experiences in buying, visual merchandising, event production, marketing, and the launching and management of online stores.",
