p Made You Look was Toronto’s first collective jewellery studio for professional designers, established in 2001. At any given time there are approximately 20 self-employed jewellery designers who create on-site in our fully-equipped Jewellery manufacturing facility. Over the years we have had professional Jewellers from all over the world be part of our environment and add to the rich culture of the community we have created. Designers pay a flat monthly fee and the studio is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. All of the designers run their own independent jewellery-making businesses and have Made You Look as one of their retail outlets.
